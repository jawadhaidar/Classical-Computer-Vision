Objects: Torus, Icosphere, Cone, Monkey

Coordinate system:
  Origin: Center of the image
  X-axis: Center to right
  Y-axis: Center to down
  Z-axis: Center going out of image

Object position: (0, 0, 0)
Camera position: (0, 0, 1)
Light positions:
  (7, -1, 5)
  (-9, -2, 6)
  (-4, 5, 7)
  (2, 3, 10)
  (10, 0, 10)
  (0, -7, 7)
  (0, 0, 10)

Light intensity: constant throughout. So assuming no falloff with distance.
